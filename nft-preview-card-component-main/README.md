## Overview

a beginner challenge to build a NFT card component component on front-end mentor.io. A great newbie challenge that requires the use of a few basic CSS properties. The Layout was created and centered using flexbox.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my knowledge in creating the layout for a simple card component and also styling it. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different box shadows and also border radius which i hadn't done previously.

### Continued development

I had some challenges during this project. Firstly the border radius of the nft image only applied at the top and not the bottom. I will spend more time reviewing this and figure how to apply the property on all corners. Secondly, the challenge showed an active state with a blue image overlay on the nft image which i was not able to figure out. I want to expand my my knowledge on pseudo classes for any upcoming projects
